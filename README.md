# ALPCLogger
ALPCLogger fork with changes so dirty that I don't have the energy to clean up properly, so I'm keeping them in a remote branch

# New functionality
- Display module name for stackframe
- (BETA) Stackframe searcher
	- Currently has some bugs to be churned out
   	- May be very slow, and that's to be expected. On my Ryzen 9 5900 it takes ~1.9s to generate 30 debug stacktraces. This will be partially addressed soon by focused filtering.
